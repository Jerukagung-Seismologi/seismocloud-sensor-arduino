# BETA: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

SeismoCloud project: http://www.seismocloud.com

# Supported boards

* ESP8266 (NodeMCU 1.0 devkit with ESP-12E module)
* Arduino/Genuino Uno (with Ethernet Shield)
* Arduino Ethernet
* Arduino MEGA2560 (with Ethernet Shield)

Please mind that Arduino cannot update itself, so its use is discouraged in non-lab projects. If you plan to build place-and-forget devices please use **NodeMCU** or **Raspberry PI/Galileo** version: https://github.com/sapienzaapps/galileo-terremoti

## Hardware: assemble a NodeMCU/ESP8266

### Requirements for NodeMCU/ESP8266

* Arduino/Genuino IDE with ESP8266 sdk installed. If you haven't ESP8266 sdk:
	* Open *Preferences* window (from *File* menu)
	* Enter `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json` into *Additional Board Manager URLs* field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
	* Close with "OK", open *Boards Manager* from *Tools* > *Board* menu and install *esp8266* platform (and don't forget to select *NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E)* board from *Tools* > *Board* menu after installation).
* NodeMCU 1.0 devkit board with ESP-12E module
* MPU6050 Accelerometer
* (optional) 3 LEDs (red-green-yellow) with 3 resistors

### Accelerometer MPU6050

Link these pins from Accelerometer MPU6050 to NodeMCU board:

* 3v3: 3v3
* GND: GND
* SDA: D1
* SCL: D2

### (optional) LEDs

Remember to put a resistor with LED (after/before is not really important) to limit
current flowing, otherwise you may damage the NodeMCU board.

By default, LED pins are:

* Pin D0 : Yellow
* Pin D3 : Green
* Pin D4 : Red

## Hardware: assemble an Arduino/Genuino

### Requirements for Arduino/Genuino

* Arduino/Genuino IDE
* Arduino/Genuino board (Arduino Uno with Ethernet Shield with SD-reader or Arduino Ethernet with SD-reader)
* MMA7361 Accelerometer
* (optional) 3 LEDs (red-green-yellow) with 3 resistors
* (optional; strongly recommended) Arduino ISP and SD-card (any size >= 10 MB)

We recommend to buy Arduinos on official website https://store.arduino.cc

### Accelerometer MMA7361

Link these pins from Accelerometer MMA7361 to Arduino board:

* Vin: 5v
* GND: GND
* SEL: GND
* X: A0
* Y: A1
* Z: A2

Loop back **3v3** pin to **SLP** on Accelerometer.

### (optional) LEDs

Remember to put a resistor with LED (after/before is not really important) to limit
current flowing, otherwise you may damage the Arduino board.

By default, LED pins are:

* Pin 2 : Yellow
* Pin 5 : Green
* Pin 3 : Red

### Burning a new bootloader with Arduino ISP for self-upgrade

TODO: avr_boot

## Software

### Network requirements

If you have any firewall in your network, please allow these ports:

* TCP: 8883 (outgoing)

### Build and upload code

1. Download the source code (for stable releases, please checkout latest git tag)
2. Open project in Arduino IDE
3. Choose the right **Port** and **Board** into **Tools** menu
4. Compile and upload (2nd button below menus) in your board
5. Open SeismoCloud app and register your device. Enjoy!

### LED status description (Arduino-only)

LEDs can be in these different states:

* **Green**: device is ready
* **Green + Yellow**: device is ready but there is an issue connecting to SeismoCloud APIs
* **Green + Red (only for about 5 seconds)**: shake detected
* **Yellow ONLY - blinking**: no position available - initialize Seismometer with Android/iOS App
* **Green + Yellow + Red**: software is loading
* **Green + Yellow + Red - ALL blinking fast**: software is loaded, starting accelerometer
* **Green + Yellow + Red - ALL blinking slow**: network init failed
* **Yellow + Red - ALL blinking**: EEPROM failed
